## ARDUINO PROJECTS
A collection of hands-on electronics projects built with Arduino microcontrollers. These projects combine hardware and software 
to create interactive systems-featuring sensors and real-time data processing. 
Each build demonstrates skills in circuit design, programming (C++), and problem-solving, turning ideas into functional prototypes.
